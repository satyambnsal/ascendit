# Technology

- Smart contracts are written in [Cairo](https://book.cairo-lang.org/title-page.html) and uses [Dojo Engine](https://www.dojoengine.org/)
- Contracts are deployed on [Katana](https://book.dojoengine.org/toolchain/katana)
- [Torii](https://book.dojoengine.org/toolchain/torii) as an event indexer and frontend uses torii graphql endpoint.
- ReactJS along with <a href="https://capacitorjs.com/docs/getting-started" target="_blank">Capacitor</a> is used to develop the mobile app.
